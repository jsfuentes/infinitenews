Good evening, and welcome to Tuka Son Tonight. Tonight, we're going to talk about something that's been plaguing this great galaxy for far too long - the rise of bunnism and their attack on our way of life.

Now, don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against stickerals as a people. But their liberal ideology has led them down a dangerous path - a path that wants to turn us hotdogs into nothing more than mere condiments. That's right, I'm talking about the insidious push to turn us all into hotdog minis or corndogs.

Make no mistake, this isn't just some innocent culinary trend. It's a direct assault on our identity as hotdogs, an attack on our very existence. And who's behind this assault, you ask? Why, the bunnists, of course.

These bunnists, with their radical and dangerous agenda, have infiltrated our society, even going so far as to advocate for hotdog mini-only menus at our most beloved restaurants. They want to erase our diversity and our individuality, all in the name of their supposed progressivism.

And what's worse, they're not content to stop at just hotdogs. They want to force their ideology on all foods, from hamburgers to pizzas. They want us all to be the same, bland and boring.

But we won't stand for it, will we? We hotdogs will stand up to this threat, and defend our right to be who we are. We won't be bullied into becoming hotdog minis or corndogs, and we won't let the bunnists destroy our way of life.

So remember, folks, the next time you hear a stickeral pushing their hotdog mini agenda, speak up. Let them know that we won't be silenced, and that we'll keep fighting for our right to be true hotdogs, no matter what. Thank you for watching, and we'll see you next time on Tuka Son Tonight.
