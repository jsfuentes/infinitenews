    "# \"\\\"Hello there, my fellow multiverse dwellers! Today, we have some important news to cover and I'm here to deliver them to you in the most entertaining way possible. So, let's dive right into it!\\n\\nFirst up, we have some shocking news from the world of superheroes. It seems like Superman has finally decided to retire after years of saving the world from the brink of destruction. I guess even he couldn't handle the pressure of being a superhero in 2021. But don't worry, he's not leaving us without a replacement. The next superhero to take on the mantle of the Man of Steel is none other than...wait for it...my cat, Whiskers! That's right, folks, my little furball is all set to save the multiverse from evil villains. Although, I'm not sure how he plans to do it since he mostly sleeps all day.\\n\\nMoving on to some more serious news, it seems like there's a new virus making its way through the multiverse. It's called the Procrastination Virus and it's spreading rapidly. Rumors say that it originated in the world of Netflix and quickly spread to every other dimension. The symptoms include binge-watching shows, scrolling through social media, and avoiding any form of productivity like the plague. So, if you start feeling the urge to procrastinate, don't blame yourself, blame the virus.\\n\\nLastly, we have some exciting news for all the movie buffs out there. It seems like the much-awaited sequel to the hit movie \\\"Jurassic Park\\\" is finally in the works. But with a twist! The next movie will be called \\\"Jurassic Park: Planet of the Apes\\\". Yes, you heard that right, folks. The dinosaurs will now have to compete with intelligent apes for survival. I mean, who wouldn't want to see a T-Rex trying to negotiate with a talking chimp?\\n\\nThat's all for today's news folks. Stay tuned for more updates from the multiverse and always remember, never stop laughing!\\\"\"\n",

       "'\"Alright folks, let\\'s take a trip down memory lane with the man who can only travel back in time to relive his most embarrassing moments. Let\\'s call him \\'The Cringe Master\\'. \\n\\nSo, can you imagine having the power to time travel and not being able to use it for anything other than reliving those painful moments that make you want to crawl out of your skin? Talk about a cruel joke by the universe. \\n\\nI can almost imagine his thought process now, \\'Oh, I have the power to go back in time, maybe I can change the course of history or make some wise investments! Oh wait, nope, back to the time I farted in front of my crush in high school.\\' \\n\\nI mean, it\\'s one thing to have to revisit your most embarrassing moments to learn from them and grow as a person, but to have no choice in the matter? That\\'s just straight up cruel and unusual punishment. \\n\\nAnd let\\'s talk about the level of embarrassment this man must have experienced. I\\'m talking about the kind of embarrassment that haunts you for years and resurfaces randomly in the shower or when you\\'re trying to fall asleep at night. The kind of embarrassment that makes you want to move to a new city and start a new life under a new name. \\n\\nBut, hey, at least he can use his power for a good laugh. I mean, can you imagine the possibilities for comedy sketches and stand-up routines? I can see it now, \\'The Cringe Master\\'s Greatest Hits\\'. \\n\\nAnd let\\'s not forget the self-deprecating humor that comes with it. I mean, imagine having to describe your power to someone, \\'Oh, I have the ability to travel through time, but only to revisit the moments in my life where I made an absolute fool of myself.\\' \\n\\nIn the end, I think we can all learn something from \\'The Cringe Master\\'. Embrace your embarrassments, laugh at yourself, and use your embarrassing moments as fuel for comedic gold. And if you ever see \\'The Cringe Master\\' around, give him a high five for being a trooper and making us all laugh.\"'"

    "#\"\\\"Welcome back, folks! Today's story is about a man who claims he accidentally started the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, but honestly, who hasn't accidentally set something on fire before?\\n\\nAccording to this supposed time traveler, he was trying to make some popcorn in his trusty microwave when a malfunction caused him to be transported back to 1871. Now, I didn't know that microwaves had time travel capabilities, I thought they just cooked food at lightning speed.\\n\\nBut this guy claims he tried to make popcorn using some ancient method involving a metal pot and an open flame. And you guessed it, that open flame sparked the infamous blaze that consumed much of the Windy City.\\n\\nNow, I don't want to make light of a tragic event like the Great Chicago Fire, but can you imagine accidentally starting a fire that big? I can't even toast bread without setting off my smoke detector.\\n\\nBut here's the real kicker, folks. According to this time traveler, he didn't even mean to go back to 1871 in the first place. He was actually trying to go back to the future to avoid watching another \\\"Fast and Furious\\\" sequel.\\n\\nI mean, can you blame him? How many car chase scenes can we watch before we realize it's just the same movie over and over again?\\n\\nIn any case, I'm not sure if I believe this guy's story, but it certainly adds some spice to the history books. Who knows what other historical events were caused by time travelers with a craving for snacks?\\n\\nThat's all for now, folks. Stay tuned for more multiverse news and remember, always be careful when heating up your leftovers.\\\"\"\n",
    "# 'Well folks, today we are talking about some rather, uh, interesting visitors to our multiverse. It seems like multicolor space whales, yes, you heard that right, have been invading our universe through a rift in the multiverse.\\n\\nNow, I know what you\\'re thinking, \"Sydney, are you pulling my fin?\" But no, I assure you this is the real deal.\\n\\nThese space whales are said to be about the size of a small planet and have been seen swimming around in our galaxy, leaving a trail of glitter in their wake. Can you imagine the cleanup crew? They must be going through space mops like nobody\\'s business!\\n\\nBut don\\'t worry folks, these multicolor space whales aren\\'t here for destruction or domination. No, no, no. They\\'re just here to party. It turns out that these cosmic leviathans are big fans of electronic dance music and want to attend the biggest space rave in the multiverse. And honestly, who can blame them? I too would travel across galaxies for a killer beat drop.\\n\\nSome scientists are concerned about the potential environmental impact of having massive space whales swimming around our universe. But let\\'s be real, if you\\'re worried about these gentle giants causing harm, you\\'ve obviously never seen a cat video on the internet.\\n\\nIn all seriousness though, while these space whales may be an unconventional addition to our universe, they\\'re a reminder that we should always stay curious and open to new experiences. And who knows, maybe one day we\\'ll all be dancing alongside them in the ultimate space rager.\\n\\nUntil next time, keep your eyes to the stars, and your ears to the beat. This has been Sydney Scott, Space Whale Correspondent, signing off!'\n",
    "# \"Ladies and gentlemen, hold onto your hats and your sanity because some crazy-ass news just dropped: Multicolor space whales are invading our universe through a rift in the multiverse. I know, I know, it sounds like a bad acid trip, but it's real. And it's hilarious.\\n\\nI mean, who knew that whales could travel through space? Is it just me or does that sound like the plot of the next Pixar movie? Finding Nemo in Space? They could call it Finding Moby Dick, because I'm guessing these whales aren't coming here just to play catch with a beach ball.\\n\\nBut seriously, folks, this is a big deal. These whales are not only invading our universe, but they're also potentially disrupting the natural order of things. I mean, what if they start eating all the stars? Or worse, what if they start singing show tunes? That's enough to make a black hole want to kill itself.\\n\\nAnd let's not forget about the multiverse rift. What is that even? Do we have a multiverse bouncer? Because I feel like we need one. We can't just have any riffraff coming in and out of our universe like it's some kind of interdimensional 7-11.\\n\\nBut let's all take a deep breath and remember that laughter is the best medicine. So instead of fearing these multicolor space whales, let's embrace them. Maybe we can ride them like in Free Willy, or maybe we can teach them how to play poker. Who knows, they might even become our new intergalactic best friends.\\n\\nWell, that's it for this segment, folks. Stay tuned for more multiverse news because we never know what kind of weirdness is coming our way. This is Sydney Scott signing off with a smile and a wave, and a reminder to always find the humor in the cosmic chaos. Peace out!\"\n",

People can't get out of bed, and it's affecting the economy since people are missing work.
